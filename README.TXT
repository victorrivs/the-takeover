Project: The Takeover
Author: Victor Riveros

This game consists of a text-based adventure where the user must travel between rooms that 
are connected, collecting various items such as weapons and keys. The user encounters 
obstacles along the way such as enemies and riddles that must be defeated to continue. The game
culminates in a “Final Boss” style fight that determines if the user is a winner.  

This project represented an exploration into Object Oriented Programming, in which various classes 
were created and interlaced to create the final product.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.
